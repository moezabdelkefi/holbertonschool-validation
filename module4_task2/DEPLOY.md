# Deployment Instructions

## Preparing a Release

When a new version of the application is ready for deployment,
create a Git tag and push it to the remote repository. This triggers
 the automated build process and creates a ZIP archive of the application.

## Deploying a Release

To deploy a release, download the ZIP archive from the GitHub release page.
The archive is named `awesome-website.zip` and is associated with the Git
tag for the release.
